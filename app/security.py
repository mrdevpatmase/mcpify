    Ensure URL has a scheme and strip query string/fragment - those are
    never meaningful as part of a base URL. The path IS kept: plenty of
    real APIs are deliberately hosted under a path on a shared domain
    (e.g. "https://dog.ceo/api", "https://api.stripe.com/v1") and every
    endpoint call this app makes is built by appending onto this base, so
    dropping that path silently breaks those APIs - verified live against
    dog.ceo/api, where every call_api call 404'd once the /api prefix was
    lost. This used to strip the path too (to handle someone pasting a
    full marketing-page URL from their browser, e.g.
    "https://example.com/landing/page?x=1", rather than the bare domain -
    see git history), but that traded a silent wrong-data bug (a real API
    quietly returning 404s from the wrong base) for a softer, recoverable
    one (a mis-scoped page still yields a working proxy, just possibly
    probed under the wrong sub-path - the user can retry with the
    corrected URL if so). Silent wrong data is worse, so path wins.

    Shared by analyzer.py, proxy.py, and main.py so a URL is normalized
    the same way no matter which entry point receives it.

    64:ff9b::/96 (RFC 6052's NAT64 "Well-Known Prefix") is a special case:

    bits, synthesized by DNS64 on IPv6-only/NAT64 networks for IPv4-only
    hosts - verified live (stripe.com and badssl.com resolved to this on

    is_reserved=True (it's a special-purpose IANA block), which would
    reject every ordinary public IPv4-only site whenever DNS64
    synthesizes this instead of returning a plain A record - unwrap it
